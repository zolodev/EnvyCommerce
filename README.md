# EnvyCommerce

Production ready: **NO**.

This project is still a _Work in Progress_.

If you want to support the cause and our work please reach out by creating an issue.

## Background to EnvyCommerce

Everything starts from something, an idea or vision. This is a short story about why we are doing what we believe in. To create an amazing experience for others and to bring joy into sharing.

### Why you should not Envy others

Many people have a dream of starting their own eCommerce business. When they start researching and looking around on the internet, they often find the more common solutions like `shopify`, `BigCommerce` or `WooCommerce`. These solutions can offer an easy and quick way to get started with eCommerce. Their services look like great choices to begin with.
What all these solutions have in common is that they do not tell you that it will lock you into their specific solution or that you have to sell your products for an overprice in order to make a profit, due to the fee they take from you as a customer and/or maintenance cost for hosting your own.

### How others will Envy you

This is why we started to create **EnvyCommerce**!

We want to make a fast, SEO friendly and easy to use eCommerce **FOR FREE** for **you**! If you have a startup or a small to medium size business, EnvyCommerce is the perfect platform to start with. Where you as the store owner will **get 100% revenue of everything you sell!**

With us you have no hidden fees due to the nature of _Open Source_ and where we strive to keep down the maintenance cost to the bare minimum. By using modern web development technologies, so you can **host it for FREE**. Where you as the store owner get all the revenue, with an exception for the `payment service` (we provide one solution to begin with) and `domain name` of your choices with **no vendor lock-in**.
We also plan for _your_ `exit strategy` and believe you should have the right to choose and to be able to move _from_ EnvyCommerce to any other solution of _your_ choice in the future. By using standard formats like _Markdown_ files for pages and products, to make the transition as easy and painless as possible if that time comes. For you to **focus on your business** instead of maintaining the technical parts of your eCommerce.

We wish you to be a successful store owner and we hope you will provide feedback to improve EnvyCommerce. That you believe in sharing your thoughts and story with us as we love to hear about your success.

## Adding Pages or Products

In the folder `Products` adding a new Markdown file will add the product.
However, the product will _not_ be published by default. To publish a Product the product requires a `Publish Date`.

## Developers

### Prerequisite

To be able to run this project, make sure you have the prerequisite in order and the latest version of the following application listed below.

- NodeJS
- Yarn
- [Fira-code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing) (font to make sure vscode code looks nice)
- Run the script `scripts/install-vscode-extensions.sh` to install the necessary vscode extensions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Learn More about Next.js

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
