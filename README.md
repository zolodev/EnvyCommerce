# EnvyCommerce

## Background to EnvyCommerce

### The why

Many people dream of starting their own eCommerce business. When they start researching and looking around on the internet, they often find the more common solutions like `shopify`, `BigCommerce` or `WooCommerce`. These solutions can offer an easy and quick way to get started with an eCommerce. Their services look like great choices to begin with.
What all these solutions have in common is that they do not tell you that it will lock you into their specific solution or that you have to sell your products for an overprice in order to make a small amount of money (if any), due to the fee they take from you as a customer.

### The how

This is why we started to create **EnvyCommerce**!

We want to make a great eCommerce **FOR FREE** for **you**! If you have a start-up or a small to medium size businesses. EnvyCommerce is the perfect platform to start with. Where you as the store owner will get 100% revenue of everything you sell!

With no hidden fees due to the nature of _Open Source_ and where we strive to keep down the maintenance cost to a bare minimum. Where you as the store owner get all the revenue, with an exception for the `payment service` (one to begin with) and `domain name` of your choices. With **no vendor lock-in**. We plan for _your_ `exit strategy` and believe you should be able to switch _from_ EnvyCommerce to any other solution of _your_ choice in the future. By using standard formats like _Markdown_ files to make the transition as easy and painless as possible when that time comes.

We wish you to be a successfull store owner and on your journey, we hope you will provide feedback to improve this product. That you believe in sharing as we do.

### What makes us do it?

Sharing is caring!
This is why we believe in Open Source and why this project is licensed under [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3](/LICENSE).

Good luck and we (the EnvyCommerce community) hope to hear from you and that you enjoy using EnvyCommerce.

## Adding Pages or Products

In the folder `Products` adding a new Markdown file will add the product.
However, the product will _not_ be published by default. To publish a Product the product requires a `Publish Date`.

## Developers

### Prerequisite

To be able to run this project, make sure you have the prerequisite in order and the latest version of the following application listed below.

- NodeJS
- Yarn
- [Fira-code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing) (font to make sure vscode code looks nice)
- Run the script `scripts/install-vscode-extensions.sh` to install the necessary vscode extensions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Learn More about Next.js
